# Open-Breviary
A simple, open-source Android app to pray the Liturgy of the Hours.


When looking through the Fdroid repositories, I found very few Catholic apps. This is my first contribution to try to change that.

I quickly threw together this program in MIT AppInventor to enable quick access to the different prayers hosted on iBreviary's website.

To download the app, check out this repo's releases, or add [my F-Droid repository](https://github.com/2br-2b/Fdroid-repo) and install it from there.
