# Open-Breviary
A simple, open-source Android app to pray the Liturgy of the Hours.


When looking through the Fdroid repositories, I found very few Catholic apps. This is my first contribution to try to change that.

I quickly threw together this program in MIT AppInventor to enable quick access to the different prayers hosted on iBreviary's website.
